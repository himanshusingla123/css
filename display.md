Certainly! In CSS, the `display` property is used to define the rendering behavior of an element. Here are some common values for the `display` property and their differences:

1. **`block`**:
   - Renders the element as a block-level element.
   - Takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.
   - Examples: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`.

2. **`inline`**:
   - Renders the element as an inline element.
   - Takes up only as much width as necessary, and does not start on a new line.
   - Examples: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`.

3. **`inline-block`**:
   - Combines features of both `block` and `inline`.
   - Takes up only as much width as necessary, but allows setting height and width properties.
   - Does not start on a new line.
   - Examples: `<img>`, `<button>`.

4. **`none`**:
   - Hides the element from the page layout.
   - The element and its space are not rendered.
   - Commonly used for hiding and showing elements dynamically with JavaScript.

5. **`flex`**:
   - Enables a flex container, and its children become flexible items.
   - Allows easy alignment and distribution of space among items in a container.
   - Useful for creating responsive layouts.

6. **`grid`**:
   - Enables a grid container, and its children become grid items.
   - Defines a two-dimensional grid-based layout system.
   - Provides precise control over the placement of items within the grid.

These values give you flexibility in structuring and styling your layout based on the specific requirements of your design.
