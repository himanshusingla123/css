In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), gradients are used to create smooth transitions between two or more colors. There are several types of gradients in CSS, each providing different ways to blend colors. Here are the main types:

1. **Linear Gradient:**
   - A linear gradient creates a transition between two or more colors along a straight line.
   - It is defined using the `linear-gradient()` function.
   - Example:
     ```css
     background: linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow);
     ```

2. **Radial Gradient:**
   - Radial gradients create a transition from the center to the outer edges in a circular pattern.
   - It is defined using the `radial-gradient()` function.
   - Example:
     ```css
     background: radial-gradient(circle, red, yellow);
     ```

3. **Repeating Linear Gradient:**
   - This is an extension of the linear gradient where the gradient pattern repeats.
   - It is useful for creating a continuous gradient effect.
   - Example:
     ```css
     background: repeating-linear-gradient(45deg, red, yellow 10%, green 20%);
     ```

4. **Repeating Radial Gradient:**
   - Similar to the repeating linear gradient, this creates a repeating radial gradient pattern.
   - Example:
     ```css
     background: repeating-radial-gradient(circle, red, yellow 10%, green 20%);
     ```

5. **Conic Gradient:**
   - A conic gradient creates a smooth color transition in a circular manner around a center point.
   - It is defined using the `conic-gradient()` function.
   - Example:
     ```css
     background: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green);
     ```

6. **Gradient Color Stops:**
   - Gradients can have color stops to define specific points where the color transitions occur.
   - Color stops are specified with positions (percentages or absolute lengths).
   - Example:
     ```css
     background: linear-gradient(to right, red 20%, yellow 50%, green 80%);
     ```

7. **Transparent Gradients:**
   - Gradients can include transparent colors, allowing for subtle blending with the background.
   - Example:
     ```css
     background: linear-gradient(to right, transparent, red, transparent);
     ```

These gradient types provide flexibility for creating visually appealing backgrounds and effects in web development.
